        <p class="title">Trips and Vacations</p>
        <p class="descp">
            A vacation (American English) or holiday (British English) is either a leave of absence from a regular 
            job or an instance of leisure travel away from home. People often take a vacation during specific holiday 
            observances or for specific festivals or celebrations. Vacations are often spent with friends or family.
            Vacations may include a specific trip or journey, usually for the purpose of recreation or tourism.
        </p>
        <p class="descp">
            Research on the effects of vacations on health, well-being and work performance started in the 1990s. 
            The first meta-analysis on the effects of vacations was published in 2009.
            A 2013 literature review on the health and wellness benefits of travel experiences revealed beneficial effects of vacationing.
            More recent studies report on the positive effects of vacations as both a passive recovery process due to removal from job stress 
            and as the active pursuit of relaxing, pleasurable and physical activities.

        <p class="title">Cyber World</p>
        <p class="descp">
            Cyberspace is a global and dynamic domain (subject to constant change) characterized by the combined use of
            electrons and the electromagnetic spectrum, whose purpose is to create, store, modify, exchange, share,
            and extract, use, eliminate information and disrupt physical resources. Cyberspace includes: 
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Physical infrastructures and telecommunications devices that allow for the connection of technological and communication system networks.</li>
                <li>Computer systems (see point a) and the related (sometimes embedded) software that guarantee the domain's basic operational functioning and connectivity.</li>
                <li>Networks between computer systems.</li>
                <li>Networks of networks that connect computer systems (the distinction between networks and networks of networks is mainly organizational).</li>
                <li>The access nodes of users and intermediaries routing nodes.</li>
                <li>Constituent data (or resident data). Often, in common parlance (and sometimes in commercial language), networks of networks are called the Internet (with a lowercase i), while networks between computers are called intranet.</li>

        <p class="title">Nature and Surroundings</p>
        <p class="descp">
            Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. 
            "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
            The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, 
            human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
            The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura,
            or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".
            In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), 
            which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants,animals, and other features 
            of the world to develop of their own accord.
